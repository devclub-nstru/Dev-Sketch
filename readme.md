## 🛠️ Technical Stack

## 🖥️ Frontend

The frontend of **Dev-Sketch** is built using **Next.js**, a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation. This choice allows for improved performance and SEO capabilities. The frontend is designed to provide a seamless user experience with the following features:

- **Interactive UI:** Built with **Tailwind CSS**, the UI is responsive and customizable, allowing users to interact with the application intuitively.
- **State Management:** Utilizes **Redux** for managing application state, ensuring that data flows efficiently between components.
- **Real-time Features:** Integrates **WebSockets** for real-time communication, enabling collaborative features like drawing and coding.

## 🌐 Backend Communication

The backend layer of **Dev-Sketch** is built using **Express**, a minimal and flexible Node.js framework that facilitates the creation of robust web applications. This layer is responsible for handling requests and responses between the client and the server.

### Key Features:

- **Express Framework:** Utilizes Express to create a RESTful API that handles various HTTP requests, including GET, POST, and DELETE, allowing for efficient communication between the client and server.

- **CORS Middleware:** Implements Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to enable secure cross-origin requests, ensuring that the frontend can communicate with the backend without security issues.

- **JSON Parsing:** Uses middleware to automatically parse incoming JSON requests, simplifying data handling and making it easier to work with client-sent data.

- **Error Handling:** Incorporates robust error handling mechanisms to manage failed requests and provide meaningful feedback to users, enhancing the overall user experience.

- **Database Interaction:** Leverages Prisma ORM for seamless interaction with the database, managing data persistence for various entities such as chat messages and shapes.

By utilizing these features, the backend of **Dev-Sketch** ensures a structured and efficient way to handle HTTP requests, enabling smooth communication and data management between the client and server.

## 🔗 WebSocket Communication

WebSockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single TCP connection, allowing for real-time data exchange. In **Dev-Sketch**, WebSockets are used for:

- **Real-time Collaboration:** Users can join rooms and interact with each other in real-time, with updates being pushed instantly to all connected clients.
- **Event Handling:** The WebSocket server listens for various events (e.g., joining a room, sending messages) and processes them accordingly, ensuring a smooth collaborative experience.

By leveraging these technologies, **Dev-Sketch** aims to deliver a responsive and interactive platform for users to collaborate effectively.
