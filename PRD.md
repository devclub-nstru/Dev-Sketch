# Product Requirements Document

## Project Name: Dev-Sketch
**Version: 1.0**

## Introduction
Dev-Sketch is a collaborative real-time platform that allows users to draw, code, and communicate within shared virtual spaces. The goal is to enable seamless creative and technical collaboration by integrating an interactive canvas, a real-time code editor, and a communication system (text & voice chat).

As technology advances, real-time collaboration has become an essential part of creative and technical workflows. Dev-Sketch aims to bridge the gap between artistic expression and coding, offering a unified space for brainstorming, prototyping, and innovation. The platform seeks to enhance the efficiency of remote teams, students, and professionals working together in real-time, whether for hackathons, design sprints, or educational purposes.

## Objectives

1. **Seamless Collaboration**
   - Enable real-time shared drawing and sketching.
   - Provide a live collaborative coding environment with multi-language support.
   - Facilitate instant text and voice communication between users.

2. **Enhanced User Experience**
   - Offer an intuitive and responsive UI/UX for smooth interactions.
   - Optimize real-time performance with low latency.
   - Provide customization options for toolbar placement, colors, and drawing tools.

3. **Scalability & Performance**
   - Ensure optimized database and WebSocket performance for real-time collaboration.
   - Implement efficient error handling and debugging mechanisms.
   - Integrate cloud storage and persistence for project recovery.

4. **Security & Authentication**
   - Secure user authentication using JWT or OAuth (Google, GitHub login).
   - Implement end-to-end encryption for chat and collaborative sessions.

5. **Future Growth & Expansion**
   - Develop AI-powered code suggestions and drawing enhancements.
   - Expand platform accessibility with mobile app development for iOS and Android.
   - Support plugin and API integration for third-party tools.
